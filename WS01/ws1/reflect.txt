In this workshop, I learned how to define an external variable and access it from different translation units. In this workshop, we defined the g_sysClock variable as an external variable by using the extern keyword. Also, I learned how to define a static variable that lives for the lifetime of the program but we can only access it from the local scope that it is defined in. In this workshop, I defined the counter variable as a static variable. I also learned how to receive command line arguments in our program. A challenging part of doing this workshop was realizing that I have to define a copy constructor to make the code work for part 2.
